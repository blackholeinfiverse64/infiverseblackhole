## 🔧 Changes Made

### File Modified:
`client/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx`

### Speed Adjustments:

#### **Before (Fast):**
```javascript
// Medium particles: 15-35 seconds
const duration = 15 + Math.random() * 20

// Small particles: 10-25 seconds  
const duration = 10 + Math.random() * 15

// Tiny particles: 8-20 seconds
const duration = 8 + Math.random() * 12
```

#### **After (Slower & Calmer):**
```javascript
// Medium particles: 30-70 seconds (2x slower)
const duration = 30 + Math.random() * 40

// Small particles: 25-60 seconds (2.5x slower)
const duration = 25 + Math.random() * 35

// Tiny particles: 20-50 seconds (2.5x slower)
const duration = 20 + Math.random() * 30
```
